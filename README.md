# pushbeat ![Build status](https://github.com/rock3r/pushbeat/workflows/gradle/badge.svg)

A sample GCP AppEngine Ktor REST API that showcases a simple RESTful API and a web UI.

Please note that this codebase does **not** follow best practices (has global state singletons,
effectively no authentication, etc). It is purely meant to be used for demonstrating some Ktor
features and as an add-on for a talk.
